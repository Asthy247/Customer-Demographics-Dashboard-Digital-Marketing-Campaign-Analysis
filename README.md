# Project Goal
To provide a clear, interactive visualization of customer demographics and their relationship to digital marketing campaign performance, enabling deeper insights into audience behavior and campaign effectiveness.

# Dataset
**Name:** Digital Marketing Campaign Dataset

**Source**: Kaggle

**Key Features:**

**Demographics**: Age, Gender, Income

**Campaign Details**: Channel, Type, Ad Spend, Clickthrough & Conversion Rates

**Engagement Metrics**: Website visits, Email interactions, Social shares

**Historical Behavior**: Past purchases, Loyalty points

**Target Variable**: Conversion (0/1)


# Dashboard Highlights & Analysis

**Age Distribution**: Explores the spread of customer ages, potentially highlighting age groups with higher engagement or conversion rates. 

The chart shows individual customer ages, revealing the overall age range from roughly 10-20 up to 60-70 years old, with customers of both genders represented across this spectrum.

**Gender Distribution:** Provides a clear count of customers segmented by gender, offering a foundational demographic breakdown.

**Interpretation:** The analysis reveals a higher number of male customers (4,839) compared to female customers (3,161) in this dataset. 

This suggests the campaign may be reaching or resonating more with males, or that the customer base itself is predominantly male.

**Income by Gender:** Compares average income levels between genders, which can reveal valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

**Interpretation:** Despite having fewer customers, female customers show a significantly higher average income ($415,779,484) compared to male customers ($261,534,090). 

This insight is crucial for campaign targeting, suggesting that female customers, though smaller in number, represent a higher-value segment in terms of purchasing power.

**Interactivity:** The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore different customer segments and potentially filter by 

various demographic and campaign attributes to uncover specific insights.


**Tools Used**
**Tableau Public**: For interactive dashboard design and visualization.

**Kaggle:** Source of the digital marketing campaign dataset.
